# Consistency

## Node Consistency

When the variable satisfies the unary constraints

## Arc Consistency

When all the values in a variable's domain satisfy the variable's binary constraints

# Algorithm

- Maintaining arc-consistency algorithm
- Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic: select the variable that has the smallest domain
- Degree Heuristic: select the variable that has the highest degree

# Domain Values

- Least-constraining values heuristic: return variables in order by number of cheices that are ruled out for neighboring variables
  - try least-constraining values first

# Problem Formulation

1. Local Search
2. Linear Programming
3. Constraint Satisfaction
