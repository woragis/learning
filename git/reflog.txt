git reflog show HEAD
shows history of refs of HEAD
refs branches, and maybe commits (on detached head state)

git reflog show branchname
shows history of refs of name
usually refs the commits right?


git checkout HEAD~1 # goes one commit ago
git checkout HEAD@{1} # goes one ref ago, so maybe a commit or maybe a branch
